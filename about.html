                    <h2><span class="highlight1">Located in paradise</span></h2>
                    <p>Located off the East side of South Solitary Island, Coffs Harbour NSW, King Neptune Hotel is situated within a beautiful underwater landscape, surrounded by a vast array of marine life. The thriving marine ecosystem provides a one-of-a-kind view from your bedroom, with passing fish, sharks and crustaceans to greet you in the morning and see you off to sleep at night. This incredible location provides the opportunity for a one-of-a-kind dining experience, the most memorable functions and events and a world-first mini-submarine cruise for two, which we call pod cruises.</p>

                    <h2><span class="highlight2">A marvel of engineering</span></h2>
                    <p>We went to great lengths to ensure that King Neptune Hotel is as robust as possible against its underwater environment, to ensure your safe and secure stay with us. The skeleton of the building consists of thick beams of multi-layered non-corrosive metals, such as stainless steel, aluminium, bronze and even gold. These metal beams are then coated in many layers of strong low density polyethylene, and finally a secure rubber layer, which trips an electric circuit when broken, alerting our highly competent maintenance staff to rigorously inspect and rectify the issue.</p>
